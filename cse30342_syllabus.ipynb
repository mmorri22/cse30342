    "\n",
    "But collaboration can hurt your learning, too. We want every student to have worked on every project, and to have encountered the intellectual challenges it poses. Simply asking your classmates to show you their solution and copying it hurts your learning, and constitutes academically dishonest behavior (i.e., plagiarism).\n",
    "\n",
    "We seek a middle ground in which you don't feel isolated and form productive collaborations with your classmates, but still reason through your own code. You may discuss this code with classmates and help your friends debug, but every piece of code you submit must be written by you and you must not submit wholly identical solutions. A good way to ensure this is for you to type in your solutions individually, even if you are discussing your approach with your friends and you help each other debug.\n",
